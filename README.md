### About this Brief
For this project we worked with the UX students at Hyper Island to develop a solution for a better user experience to Trimes training app.

We developed the new sign in process for Trime that is now shorter and having a welcoming video to connect with the user and just collect some necessary information to keep the user engaged. 
By this bew sign up process Trime will create curiosity and trust which will lead to more finished signups and an overall better user experience.
